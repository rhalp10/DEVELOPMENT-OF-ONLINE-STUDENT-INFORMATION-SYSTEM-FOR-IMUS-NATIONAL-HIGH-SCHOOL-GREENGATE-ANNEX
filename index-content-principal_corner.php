			<hr />
			<p><br />
			​In our five years existing as molder of the youth&hellip; So many challenges were encountered such as shortage of classrooms, chairs, insufficient instructional materials and laboratories but because of the hand in hand working together, we recuperated easily.&nbsp;<br />
			For all my colleagues I salute to your fashion in your chosen career. Your patience and motherly approach to our students is highly appreciated. I don&rsquo;t heard any negative comment from you even experienced teaching under the tent handling 125 students per class. Your hard work gave you an amazing results. You are not only a teacher who impart knowledge to our students but you are like a candle to them who give light in their life and shaping their humanity&rsquo;s future.&nbsp;<br />
			To our dear students, we are helping you to face the reality of life but you are the one who will help to yourself in pursuing your goal. Listen to us when we tell you WHAT to do. But more importantly, think about it and ask yourself WHY we told you to do it. Do not let others to ruin your life you are the driver of your own life.&nbsp; Life is all about CHANCES and OPPORTUNITIES. Never let your mind leave anything to CHANCE and never let an OPPORTUNITY get away. The opportunity given your parents &ndash; supporting you in your studies grab it do not let it away. It is the first step in doing a difference in your life. Focus on your studies.&nbsp; And when you are there always put your feet on the ground. Be an educated person with a good character.<br />
			<br />
			In the end, be a little wise!<br />
			Stay blessed in life!<br />
