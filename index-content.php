<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center;"><font color="#ffffff"><br>&#8203;"<font size="5" style="">W</font>hen we label something as a process, we also mean that it does not have a beginning, an ending, or fixed sequence of events. It is not static. It is moving. The ingredients with a process interact; each affects all of the others." -David Berlo&nbsp;<br>To be "School of Excellence" is the paramount goal of Imus National High School-Greengate Annex. This institution aims for what is best for its stakeholders especially the learners who are the hopes and dreams of this nation. In order to excel, one has to undergo a series of process; a process which has no beginning, middle nor ending. As the proverb says, "Many hands light work." and if each individual knows how to make things work, the process won't be painful, but fruitful. In order to achieve the educational goals set by the Department of Education, Imus National High School-Greengate Annex, together with a pool of competent teachers from each department, has set its plans and objectives to be accomplished by the end of each quarter and at the end of the school year. The school has committed itself in its mission of equipping every learner with competencies and life-long skills capable of surviving the 21st century demands and standards.<br><br>by: Ms. Darizzeth Gelle</font></div>
